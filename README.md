Blockchain technology entails a distributed database that autonomously maintains a continuously growing list of transactions recorded in units called blocks and secured from tampering and revision.

Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block. The blockchain could potentially enhance transaction transparency and supply chain traceability. Trade finance practitioners claim that moving to paperless trade would be hugely beneficial in supporting the supply chain through reduced costs, error-free documentation, and fast transfer of documents to customers.

Upon purchase, the agreement of sale between the importer and exporter is shared with the import bank using a Smart Contract on the Blockchain.

In real-time, the import bank will have the capability to review the purchase agreement, draft terms of credit, and submit the obligation to pay to the export bank.

The export bank will review the provided payment obligation, and once approved, a Smart Contract will be generated on the Blockchain to cover terms and conditions and lock-in obligations.
